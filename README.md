This is the Noodle Extensions guide created by me to help out players on their noodlin' journey.

Please follow to the [wiki](https://github.com/UGEcko/Noodle-Extensions-Sort-of-guide/wiki)

If you are interested in learning the deep ends of what is written in the wiki, you can find most of the lines of code on a javascript learning site.
I use the [Javascript Tutorial by W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
